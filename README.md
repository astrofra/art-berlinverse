# Berlinverse

Berlinverse is a hybrid art project combining archival “lost + found” photography with an immersive virtual reality investigation space set in 1950s Berlin.

The project originates from the extraction of anonymous portraits from flea-market negatives. These images form the basis of a fictional investigation into a machine whose inventor lost control, sending its subjects into another universe. The installation unfolds across two complementary forms: a physical display of photographic prints arranged like a police investigation board, and a first-person VR experience.

## VR Experience

The VR component places the viewer in the role of an investigator, seated in a sparse post-war German office. From a first-person perspective, the user observes the desk, documents, walls, and a single window overlooking Berlin’s brick buildings and the Fernsehturm in the distance. The experience is contemplative, narrative-driven, and designed for seated immersion.

The virtual environment focuses on:
- Minimalist, historically grounded set design  
- Readable spatial composition for VR comfort  
- Subtle environmental storytelling through objects and materials  

## Technology

- **Engine:** Harfang3D  
- **Language:** Python / Lua (depending on implementation)  
- **Target:** Seated VR installation  

Harfang3D is used for its low-level control, lightweight pipeline, and suitability for research-creation and installation-based VR projects.

## Status

Work in progress - concept art, environment prototyping, and interaction design currently under development.
